 Foreword
When wool merchants in 14th-century Florence recorded their first free transactions in account books, no one realized it was the seed of capitalism—like a seed accidentally dropped in a crevice, it quietly took root under the feudal system and eventually grew into a towering tree that overturned the old world.

Today, we stand at the threshold of another turning point in civilization.

When open-source community code flows freely beyond commercial barriers; when blockchain-based credits enable individuals to reap direct rewards for their contributions; when distributed collaboration allows strangers to jointly deliver aerospace-grade projects; when ordinary people gain a say in public affairs through node networks—these seemingly isolated phenomena are weaving a brand-new network of civilization: the germination of decentralization.

We live in an era rife with contradictions. The centralized pyramids of capital and power still stand tall, and monopolies, corruption, rat races, and trust crises plague every corner. Yet at the same time, forces resisting centralization are breaking through the soil—from the open-source movement on the internet to the transparent mechanisms of blockchain, from the collaborative models of the sharing economy to global civic environmental initiatives. Through countless trials and errors, humanity is seeking a fairer, more resilient way of survival.

Just as the seeds of capitalism were once dismissed as "abnormal" by feudal lords, today’s decentralized explorations face skepticism and suppression. But the laws of history have never changed: any model that aligns with human nature and complies with the laws of nature will eventually break free from its shackles. Decentralization is not about abolishing order, but about reconstructing it—it resembles the topological structure of the universe, where countless independent small pyramids connect with each other, preserving individual freedom and creativity while forming powerful synergy through rules. It is like the ecological chains of nature, with no absolute top tier; every participant is both a creator and beneficiary of value.

This story is not a utopian fantasy, but a record of unfolding realities. Through the struggles of Lin Mo, Su Wan, and countless nodes, we aim to show the evolutionary trajectory of decentralization—from an economic model to political governance, from Earth’s ecosystems to interstellar exploration. We seek to prove that when the centralization of power and capital is dismantled, and when individual value is respected and creativity unleashed, humanity is capable of unleashing immense potential.

This bud may still be fragile, but it carries humanity’s longing for fairness and aspirations for the future. Just as the seeds of capitalism ultimately shaped the modern world, today’s decentralized germination will eventually reconstruct humanity’s production relations, governance models, and the boundaries of civilization.

We do not know how many storms it will endure, nor can we predict its ultimate form, but we believe this: the progress of civilization always moves toward greater freedom, equality, and inclusivity.

And this story is a preview of the future—a tale of how humanity breaks free from the constraints of pyramids, and uses the faint light of countless nodes to illuminate a new course for civilization, ultimately reaching the realm of global harmony.

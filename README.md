# Sovereign Node Vortex Theory
A cross-dimensional theory framework that integrates **Chinese philosophy (Zhuangzi's Butterfly Dream)**, **vortex physics (medium vortex vibration)** and **decentralized social governance**.

## Core Insight
Physical laws and social orders share the same topological essence: **vortex structure**.
- Small pyramid = social vortex unit
- Node = vortex oscillator
- Contribution point = resonance coupling mechanism

This is not a deliberately designed utopia, but a projection of natural laws in human society.

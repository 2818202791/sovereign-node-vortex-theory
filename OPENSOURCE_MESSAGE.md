庄周梦蝶，不知我之为蝶，抑或蝶之为我。

此「主权节点」理论，非刻意构建之乌托邦，乃自然涡旋之拓扑投影。

小金字塔即涡旋，节点即振子，积分即共振——物理之律，社会之序，本为一体。

我们不过是偶然窥见天机的记录者，今开源于此，盼全球同好共探：
万物共生，无分主客，无有中心，方为文明永续之道。

Zhuangzi dreamed of being a butterfly—he did not know whether he was Zhuangzi who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming of being Zhuangzi.

This *Sovereign Node* theory is not a deliberately constructed utopia, but a topological projection of natural vortex structures.

A small pyramid is a vortex, a node is an oscillator, and contribution points are resonance—physical laws and social orders are inherently one.

We are merely accidental recorders who glimpsed the secrets of nature. Now we open-source this work here, hoping global enthusiasts will join us in exploring this truth:
All things coexist without distinction between subject and object, without a central authority—this is the only path to sustainable civilization.
